# Results

What has actually been measured, with the caveats that make each number readable. Raw output is
in the JSON files beside this one; every script named here regenerates its own.

**Environment.** Windows 11, RTX 3060 (unused — `torch` is the CPU wheel by design), DuckDB
v1.5.5 (`d8cdaa33`), `anofox_tabfm` `bc6d8af`, `tabpfn` 8.2.0, `tabicl-v2` as the DuckDB-side
backbone.

**Every timing here is contended.** The box was simultaneously running an unrelated
`finetune.py` training job with two worker processes, plus this project's own background runs.
PLAN.md already requires reported figures to come from a pod; these are correctness-oriented
numbers with a comparative reading at best.

## Phase 2 — `anofox_tabfm` probe

Full write-up in [PHASE2_FINDINGS.md](PHASE2_FINDINGS.md). Two results reshaped the design.

**`tabpfn-v2-5` does not load.** Its published checkpoint no longer matches anofox's bundled
ONNX graph; re-downloading returns a byte-identical file and the same failure. `tabicl-v2` works.

**A TabPFN estimator sees 500 features, not 2,000.** 2,000 is the input ceiling; above 500,
features are subsampled per estimator (`preprocessing/configs.py:115`). Covering a
2,000-feature group needs e≥4, and anofox caps e at 1. Hence **G=40 groups of 250 kernels**
rather than the paper's G=10 × 1,000 — same kernel budget, same averaging, but one estimator
now sees a whole group.

The trap worth remembering: `tabpfn` silently auto-scales a requested `e=1` up to `e=4` to reach
coverage, so a local run labelled e=1 would really have been e=4 while the DuckDB path really
was e=1. `auto_scale_n_estimators=False` is now pinned.

| Feature columns | Default guard | Guard raised | Wall clock (60 train / 40 test) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | OK | — | 4.1 s |
| 500 | OK | — | 6.8 s |
| 512 | rejected | OK | 7.0 s |
| 1,000 | rejected | OK | 17.2 s |
| 2,000 | rejected | OK | 41.4 s |

The 500-column limit is a configurable guard (`SET anofox_tabfm_max_features`), not a model
limit — so the upstream PR the plan contemplated for wide feature lists is unnecessary. Note the
cost grows faster than the width.

## Phase 3 — SQL composition, Python features

`scripts/phase3_sql.py`. GunPoint, `tabicl-v2`, e=1, G=40.

| | |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | **0.9933** |
| SQL argmax vs. numpy argmax | **150/150** identical |
| Averaged probabilities sum to 1 | yes |
| Row alignment | 150/150 ids, 6,000 group-rows, 40–40 groups per row |
| Wall clock (40 classify calls) | 287 s |

The plan's original exit criterion — "reproduce Phase 1 accuracy exactly" — assumed both sides
run the same classifier, which is impossible now that `tabpfn-v2-5` will not load in DuckDB. So
the *plumbing* is what is checked exactly: the same per-group probabilities averaged and
argmaxed in SQL and in numpy must agree, isolating the composition from the backbone.

Row identity does not need swan's rowid-as-feature hack. `tabfm_classify` returns test rows
only, in the test view's order, stably — but rows are still recovered by joining on an echoed
feature value, and the join is asserted total, because a positional join that silently slipped
would corrupt every number while leaving the output well-formed.

## Phase 4 — `rocket_transform` in C++

Conformance against the golden vectors, `scripts/conformance.py`:

| Fixture | Shape | Max abs diff | Max PPV diff | Outside 1e-9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `features_base` | (8, 128) | 1.776e-15 | **0** | 0 / 1024 |
| `features_offset` | (8, 32) | 1.776e-15 | **0** | 0 / 256 |

`features_offset` starts at global kernel index 9,000 and is the one that matters: it proves
`first_kernel` addresses into a single bank rather than reseeding, which is the property the
whole group design rests on. A SQL test asserts the same thing directly —
`rocket_transform(s, 4, 7, 4) = rocket_transform(s, 8, 7, 0)[9:16]`.

PPV differences are held to exact zero separately from the tolerance: PPV is a ratio of small
integers, so any difference there means the two implementations disagreed about the *sign* of a
convolution output, which is a real bug rather than rounding.

Throughput, `scripts/benchmark_transform.py`, 250 kernels, 150 timepoints:

| Series | Python (numpy) | C++ extension | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | 0.108 s | 0.065 s | 1.7× |
| 4,000 | 7.961 s | 1.117 s | **7.1×** |

The gap widens with row count because parallelism comes from DuckDB scheduling the scalar
function across chunks, and 200 rows is a single chunk. The oracle is numpy-vectorised, so this
is C++-against-BLAS-ish rather than C++-against-interpreted-Python.

### Pure SQL: correct, and not an option

`sql/rocket.sql` implements the whole spec — SplitMix64 over 32-bit halves in BIGINT, the polar
method's rejection loop as a fixed draw grid plus a running count of accepted pairs, and the
convolution as a join.

| | |
|---|---|
| Max abs diff vs. oracle | 1.776e-15 |
| Max PPV diff | 0 |
| 8 kernels, 2 series, 48 timepoints | Python 0.001 s, **SQL 342 s** |

That is ~4×10⁵ slower, which closes PLAN.md's "if it is merely 5–10× slow, seriously consider
stopping here" branch. It stays as an executable statement of the spec and a zero-build fallback
for tiny inputs.

Two bugs found on the way, both of which failed far from their cause: partial products need
HUGEINT because two 32-bit factors reach 2^64 and wrap BIGINT into negatives, and three of the
six SplitMix64 constants had been transcribed from hex incorrectly.

## Phase 5 — the whole pipeline in DuckDB

`scripts/phase5_pipeline.py`. Raw series → `rocket_transform` → 500 scalar columns →
`tabfm_classify` → average `proba` → argmax, all in the database.

GunPoint, G=40, e=1:

| | |
|---|---|
| Accuracy (C++ features) | **0.9933** |
| Accuracy (Phase 3, Python features) | 0.9933 |
| **Per-row prediction agreement** | **150/150** |
| Wall clock | 261.5 s |

The per-row number is the claim worth making. Equal accuracy is the weaker statement — two runs
can match on accuracy while disagreeing about which rows they get right, so equal accuracy is
consistent with the transform being subtly wrong. Identical predictions on every row is what
says the C++ port is interchangeable with the oracle in the real pipeline, not merely conformant
on fixtures.

The loadable extension was also verified against the **stock upstream v1.5.5 CLI** in `tools/`,
not only the shell built here — the check that the pinned ABI genuinely matches rather than
being self-consistent.

### Breadth: five datasets, G=40, e=1, `tabicl-v2`

| Dataset | Test rows | Timepoints | Accuracy | Wall clock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Coffee | 28 | 286 | 1.0000 | 128 s |
| Trace | 100 | 275 | 1.0000 | 260 s |
| GunPoint | 150 | 150 | 0.9933 | 258 s |
| FaceFour | 88 | 350 | 0.9773 | 172 s |
| Beef | 30 | 470 | 0.7667 | 129 s |

Row alignment was total on every one: 40 of 40 groups scored every row, no duplicates, no drops.

**Mean accuracy 0.9475 — and it should not be compared to the paper's 0.900.** That figure is a
mean over 92 datasets with 30 resamples; this is a single split of five datasets chosen for
*spread* rather than difficulty, using a different backbone (`tabicl-v2`, because `tabpfn-v2-5`
will not load) at e=1 rather than e=8. The two numbers measure different things and the
resemblance is not evidence of anything.

What the table *is* good for is a sanity check, and it passes one: these values sit where
published ROCKET results sit on these datasets, including Beef being much the hardest — the
subset notes flagged it as "classically hard" before any of it was run. A ROCKET implementation
that was subtly wrong would be unlikely to land in the right neighbourhood on five datasets at
once while also matching the Python oracle bit-for-bit.

Timings are contended and include process startup and Parquet I/O per dataset; they scale with
test rows, as expected when the classify calls dominate.

**What Python still does:** downloads the dataset, writes Parquet, and generates the SQL text.
It computes none of the result. The generation is mechanical templating that cannot currently be
avoided, because `tabfm_classify` needs N named scalar columns — the `LIST` form crashes the
engine — so a 40-group run is ~1.1 MB of SQL.

## Not done

- **Phase 1's accuracy table and noise floor.** The harness runs and the licence gate is
  cleared; the multi-seed run was still going at the end of the session. Until it finishes there
  is **no measured noise floor**, and per PLAN.md's own rule no accuracy comparison here should
  be treated as real.
- **Anything on a pod.** No RunPod instance was created — that spends money and needs a human.
  Every number above is local.
- **Multivariate and variable-length series.** Still unspecified in SPEC.md §7, so
  `BasicMotions` remains skipped rather than silently mishandled.
- **The 92-dataset / 30-resample protocol.** Phase 5 covers five datasets on a single split.
  That is enough to rule out a one-dataset fluke and nowhere near enough to compare against the
  paper. The multivariate case is excluded by construction, and the larger datasets
  (`ECG5000`, `ItalyPowerDemand`, `OSULeaf`, `SyntheticControl`) were skipped for runtime.
- **Upstream reports.** Two are worth filing against `DataZooDE/anofox-tabfm` — the
  checkpoint/graph mismatch and the `LIST`-column internal error — but filing on a third-party
  repo is the maintainer's call to invite, so they are written up here rather than submitted.
- **`test/sql/rocket.test` through the official runner.** Its assertions were verified
  query-by-query against the built shell, but `BUILD_UNITTESTS` was off;
  `scripts/build_extension.bat tests` builds the runner and executes the file.
